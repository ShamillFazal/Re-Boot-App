# Re-Boot-App
Refactored version of Re-boot app from scratch 

During the School of Code bootcamp we were tasked with making an app that helps fellow bootcampers with their needs.

We chose to build a study app to help learners along their journey. Given the time contraints we ended up with a single page app with an embedded quiz on JS Variables. I wasn't happy with where we left the app so I decided to refactor it a little to make it a little more fit for purpose! ðŸ˜„

This is a mini refactoring project so I've been careful not to go overboard and stick to as much of our initial theme as possible.
